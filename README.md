# User Experience (UX)

## User Stories

- ## As a website owner I want:
1. The website to read in a random quiz everytime so all the answers are not always the same.
2. The website to track the users score and store it in a leaderboard.
3. The website provides users a place to come and test their knowledge.

- ## As a website user I want:
1. To easily understand the purpose of the site.
2. To be able to track my score and see where I rank among other users.
3. To test my knowledge of Movies, Games, TV Shows and Sports.

- As a Returning Website User I want:
1. The quiz to be different so that the answers ain't the same.

# 1. Strategy
- The main purpose for creating this website is to provide users with a place to test their knowledge.

# 2. Scope
- The multipage design is relatively simple and the quiz and how to play is provided to the user clearly and concisely.
- The information and quiz can be accessed and played on all devices.

# 3. Structure
- Users will find themselves on the homepage where they will met with 6 buttons.
- The 6 buttons are, "How to play", "Leaderboard", "Movies", Games", "Shows", and "Sports".
- The "How to play" button when clicked will show a popup that will explain the rules and how to play.
- The "Leaderboard" button when clicked will take you to the leaderboard page where you can see where you rank among others.
- When either of the other four buttons are clicked they will take you to the quiz page and will display questions and answers based on what was clicked, so for example if the user clicks the "Movies" button they will be brought to a page that will display movie questions and answers.
